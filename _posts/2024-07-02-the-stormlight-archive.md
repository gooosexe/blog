title: the stormlight archive review

(yeah yeah i know said that i would blog once per week or so but life gets in the way of things)

*a lazy review of the stormlight archive by brandon sanderson*
i started reading the stormlight archive around a year ago, and i had to force myself to put the series down before the school year started so i wouldn’t get incredibly distracted during class. i left off at words of radiance, and picked up the series again around a month ago to finish oathbringer and rhythm of war. 
the stormlight archive is currently a series of four books. a fifth one is set to be released this year december to finish part one, and another five books will be released for part two. the whole series is part of a larger universe called the cosmere. i haven’t read any other books in the cosmere yet, but i plan on reading the mistborn series soon.
i can honestly say that the stormlight archive is my favourite series of all time. sanderson’s world building is absolutely incredible, and the detailed descriptions provide a crazy level of immersion. 
the characters are really well developed. i particularly liked the depictions of the mental struggles for each character. kaladin’s persistent gloominess was pretty hard to deal with at times, but i suppose that’s a rather accurate representation of depression. 
anything that’s wrong about the book is immediately rectified by the existence of adolin. that guy is really funny.
uhh i honestly dont have much else to say, but the series is very good i highly recommend :)
