A Lazy Review of *The Stormlight Archive* by Brandon Sanderson

I started reading *The Stormlight Archive* around a year ago, and I had to force myself to put the series down before the school year started so I wouldn’t get incredibly distracted during class. I left off at *Words of Radiance*, and picked up the series again around a month ago to finish *Oathbringer* and *Rhythm of War*.

*The Stormlight Archive* is currently a series of four books. A fifth one is set to be released this December to finish Part One, and another five books will be released for Part Two. The whole series is part of a larger universe called the Cosmere. I haven’t read any other books in the Cosmere yet, but I plan on reading the Mistborn series soon.

I can honestly say that *The Stormlight Archive* is my favorite series of all time. Sanderson’s world-building is absolutely incredible, and the detailed descriptions provide a crazy level of immersion.

The characters are really well-developed. I particularly liked the depictions of the mental struggles for each character. Kaladin’s persistent gloominess was pretty hard to deal with at times, but I suppose that’s a rather accurate representation of depression.

Anything that’s wrong about the book is immediately rectified by the existence of Adolin. That guy is really funny.

I don’t have much else to say, but the series is very good. I highly recommend it :)
