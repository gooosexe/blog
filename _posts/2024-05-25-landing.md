Hello! Welcome to my blog. Just to give credit, this blog was set up using the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) framework and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). The setup was a little finicky, but the features are incredibly convenient. If you plan on creating your own blog, I highly recommend using Jekyll.

I’m not too sure what I’ll make of this place, so I guess I’ll figure it out as I go. I’ll try to post at least every week, although it is very likely that that will not happen. For the moment, I’ll just write about whatever comes to my mind. Maybe about things that I find interesting. I tend to have the need to spew thoughts about stuff I see online, and this is probably a better medium to do said spewing instead of harassing my friends.

Anyways, I’ve already spent a ton of time today setting this up and neglecting to do my chemistry homework, so I’ll sign off here.

Oliver
