title: unexpected changes

honestly, i thought i knew exactly what i wanted to do.
sitting in my bedroom that day at 13, i had an epiphany. i was going to ditch my 8-year-old aspirations of being an astronomer to become a software engineer. over time, the vision became incredibly clear to me. i would nestle myself in silicon valley, make enough money to drown myself in bills, and live the rest of my life in beautiful california.

so i worked. i researched and studied about working in tech. i learned to code, concept after concept and language after language. even as i hit walls and roadblocks and speedbumps and potholes, it was still clear. i *would* become a software engineer.

my dream persisted throughout high school, making little side projects and trying to make something—anything—with the skills i had acquired from perusing forums and websites. i had to make this work. i *had* to. so many years had gone into the dream that i refused to listen to the warning signs that popped up in my head.

the sun had set early that january afternoon, as it usually does during canadian winters. i was studying for the 2024 canadian computing competition, a competition administered by the university of waterloo, considered to be the mit of canada. a problem had me stumped, and i was growing increasingly frustrated at myself. did i actually like computer science, or did i simply pretend to like it? by then, i had accumulated a hefty list of side projects that i was never motivated enough to get around to. but i couldn’t let these negative thoughts cloud my problem-solving skills. no, no, no, no. the problem had to be solved.

i went to sleep, irritated and defeated. of course, i failed. and yet, despite the self-loathing and repeated failures, i was sure that this was the thing i would enjoy doing for the rest of my life.

the month of may stood in front of me, a no-longer-kid that gaslit himself into thinking he loved computer science. the last university offer rounds were beginning. it was at this point where i realized that i would never be happy doing computer science. for the first time in years, i sat myself down and truly gave up my dreams.

well, maybe that’s a little unfair. there were still embers in the corners of my heart, ones that yearned to explore the stars instead of codebases. a warmth that loved physics. i had suppressed it during my four years of high school, even as i noticed that, deep down, i had enjoyed physics more than any other class.

the offer from the university of toronto was staring me down: university of toronto - physical & mathematical sciences - st. george campus. so, i made a choice. i wasn’t sure if i would hate engineering, but i wasn’t sure if i would like it either. truth be told, i wasn’t sure about anything. but i steeled myself and listened to what third-grade oliver *was* sure of.

i’ll be going to u of t in september, studying the physical and mathematical sciences. i don’t know if i’ll want to study astrophysics by the end of my first year, but hopefully, i’ll have things figured out by then. i’m still scared. i had my life planned out before me, and i dropped all of it to pursue physics. i know very little about graduate studies in physics, and i know even less about the possible careers in physics. it’s a far cry from my knowledge of working in tech. but in the end, no matter how scared i am, it’s always better to try.

like a raging river, life won’t always go the way we want it to. the current is filled with unexpected changes, ready to whisk us away from plans we’ve laid for ourselves. sometimes, it’s better to let the river take us away. we exist for a brief moment in time, and i find that swimming against currents isn’t the most enjoyable way to spend my moment.
