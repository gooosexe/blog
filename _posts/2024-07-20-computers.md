Computers are great. A little glowing screen gives you little images and videos, with tidbits of text to go with them. Occasionally, there is more text than image. People around the world can communicate with each other with computers through a wonderful invention called the internet. The internet is likely the largest piece of data humans have ever created. 

Unfortunately, us humans do not have the greatest relationship with computers. We often blame our little machines for things that are beyond their control. Sometimes, we hit our computers. Physical trauma is not very good for a computer. People often forget that computers do exactly what you tell them to do. Every computer has done exactly what it has been told to do. This does not mean that it does what we *want* it to do. It does what it has been told. Your computer—along with all the other computers—are perfect machines, designed to follow the laws of physics perfectly. Not unlike ourselves.

Is it fair to blame the computer for mistakes caused by us? Probably not. It has only done what we have told it to do. Can we consider the computer smart? Maybe. It is not able to think, but it can do certain things very quickly. It uses a little chip, known as a central processing unit, or a CPU. Most CPUs can easily go through over one billion processes per second. The sun is about 0.15 billion meters away. 

Could you do that? No, you couldn’t.
